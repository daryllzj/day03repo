 Two.
we shook their two hands.
but our fish said, 'no! no!
those Things should not be
in this house! make them go!
they should not be here
when your mother is not!
put them out! put them out!'
said the fish in the pot.

'have no fear, little fish,'
said the cat in the hat.
'these Things are good Things.'
and he gave them a pat.
'they are tame. oh, so tame!
they have come here to play.
they will give you some fun
on this wet, wet, wet day.'

now, here is a game that they like,'
said the cat.
'they like to fly kites,'
said the cat in the hat.

'no! not in the house!'
said the fish in the pot.
'they should not fly kites
in a house! they should not.
oh, the things they will bump!
oh, the things they will hit!
oh, i do not like it!
not one little bit!'

then sally and i
saw them run down the hall.
we saw those two Things
bump their kites on the wall!
bump! thump! thump! bump!
down the wall in the hall.

thing two and thing one!
they ran up! they ran down!
on the string of one kite
we saw mother's new gown!
her gown with the dots
that are pink, white and red.
then we saw one kite bump
on the head of her bed!

then those things ran about
with big bumps, jumps and kicks
and with hops and big thumps
and all kinds of bad tricks.
and i said,
'i do NOT like the way that they play!
if mother could see this,
oh, what would she say!'

then our fish said, 'look! look!'
and our fish shook with fear.
'your mother is on her way home!
do you hear?
oh, what will she do to us?
what will she say?
oh, she will not like it
to find us this way!'

'so DO something! fast!' said the fish.
'do you hear!
i saw her. your mother!
your mother is near!
so, as fast as you can,
think of something to do!
you will have to get rid of
thing one and thing two!'

so, as fast as i could,
i went after my net.
and i said, 'with my net
i can get them i bet.
i bet, with my net,
i can get those things yet!'

then i let down my net.
it came down with a PLOP!
and i had them! at last!
those two things had to stop.
then i said to the cat,
'now you do as i say.
you pack up those Things
and you take them away!'

'oh dear!' said the cat.
'you did not like our game...
oh dear.
what a shame!
what a shame!
what a shame!'

then he shut up the things
in the box with the hook.
and the cat went away
with a sad kind of look.

'that is good,' said the fish.
'he has gone away. yes.
but your mother will come.
she will find this big mess!
and this mess is so big
and so deep and so tall,
we can not pick it up.
there is no way at all!'

and THEN!
who was back in the house?
why, the cat!
'have no fear of this mess,'
said the cat in the hat.
'i always pick up all my playthings
and so...
i will show you another
good trick that i know!'

then we saw him pick up all the things that were down.
he picked up the cake,
and the rake, and the gown,
and the milk, and the strings,
and the books, and the dish,
and the fan, and the cup,
and the ship, and the fish.
and he put them away.
then he said, 'that is that.'
and then he was gone
with a tip of his hat.

then our mother came in
and she said to us two,
'did you have any fun?
tell me. what did you do?'

and sally and i did not know
what to say.
should we tell her
the things that went on there that day?

should we tell her about it?
now, what SHOULD we do?
well...
what would YOU do
if your mother asked YOU?
